# Data-606-Capstone-Project

# Market Basket Analysis


## Introduction
Instacart, a grocery ordering and delivery software, seeks to make it simple to stock your fridge and pantry with personal favorites and necessities when you need them. Personal shoppers review your order and handle the in-store shopping and delivery for you after you pick things through the Instacart app. They are now using transactional data to build models that forecast which things a customer will buy again, try for the first time, or add to their cart next during a session. 


### Motivation
Instacart is now looking for a model that predicts the user's next order based on recent purchases. The ability to forecast which products consumers are likely to buy again and automatically add them to cart based on those predictions. By emphasizing the predicted products in such communications. I would like to make a prediction to model to test this outcome and work on Market Basket Analysis.


### Data
This project's dataset is a relational set of files describing consumer orders over time. The collection is anonymized and includes over 3 million grocery orders from over 200,000 Instacart members. For each user, information about 4 to 100 of their orders is provided, along with the order of things purchased in each order. The week and hour of day the order was placed are also accessible, as is a relative measure of time between orders. The dataset is available for non-commercial use only and can be downloaded from S3 at https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017.

### Business Understanding
Some of the questions I want to answer are:
- Predict whether or not a consumer will reorder a product in the future.

- Predict which department the next product ordered will be assigned to.


### Medthodology
Initially, I plan to delve deep into the data to gain a complete understanding of the many variables. I intend to do some data wrangling and cleaning to cope with missing values and other issues. Once the data has been cleansed, I plan to perform exploratory analysis to extract any intriguing insights from it. Feature engineering will also be used to uncover new significant features that may be employed in the model construction process. Finally, various models will be created using machine learning methods. Data visualizations will support in the communication of these findings and will help to tell a story.
